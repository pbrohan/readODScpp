The only goal of readODS is to enable R to read and write OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) files.

## Installation

Install the latest stable version from CRAN: 

```r
install.packages("readODS")
```

from R-universe:

```r
install.packages("readODS", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

Or install the development version from Github:

```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/readODS")
```

## Usage

In almost all use cases, you only need two functions: `read_ods` and `write_ods`. Simple.

#### Reading

```{r}
library(readODS)
read_ods("starwars.ods")
```

Reading from the 2nd sheet

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2)
```

Reading from a specific range

```{r}
read_ods("starwars.ods", sheet = 2, range = "A1:C11")
```

#### Writing

```{r}
## preserve the row names
write_ods(mtcars, "mtcars.ods", row_names = TRUE)
```

Appending a sheet

```{r}
write_ods(PlantGrowth, "mtcars.ods", append = TRUE, sheet = "plant")
```

```{r}
## Default: First sheet
read_ods("mtcars.ods")
```

```{r}
read_ods("mtcars.ods", sheet = "plant", range = "A1:B10")
```

### Text Encoding

In older versions of R (<4.2) on Windows, the default encoding for text is not UTF-8, and instead dependes on your locale. This can cause problems processing characters that are not part of the character set R is using (ususally [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252)). Sheets written using these characters generally contains errors. The problem can be fixed by upgrading to a version of R >= 4.2.

**Radian:** Even for up-to-date versions of R, these issues with character encoding are still a known issue with Radian. Their suggested workaround is [here](https://github.com/randy3k/radian/issues/269#issuecomment-1169663251).
